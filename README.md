**`Aspiring Devops Engineer`**

I am a dedicated professional with a degree in Chemical Engineering and 8 years of experience in Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE) roles. Throughout my career, I have developed a strong foundation in problem-solving, analytical thinking, and systems management, skills that I am now leveraging as I transition into software engineering.

Driven by a passion for technology and innovation, I am actively upskilling in programming, software development, and agile methodologies, with a focus on building efficient and scalable solutions. My engineering background, combined with a meticulous attention to detail and a deep understanding of safety and compliance standards, provides me with a unique perspective on software development, particularly in safety-critical and high-precision industries.

I am excited to apply my expertise in process optimization, technical analysis, and continuous improvement in this new field, contributing to dynamic teams where quality, innovation, and efficiency are key. Eager to collaborate on projects that drive impactful results, I am currently seeking opportunities in software engineering to further hone my skills and deliver exceptional solutions.
